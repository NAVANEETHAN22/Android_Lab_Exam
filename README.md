an Android application that allows users to enter company details (Company Name, Description, Founded Date), save the data in both SQLite and Firebase, and display the company names immediately after saving. The application will also display all saved company details in a new activity and provide a search functionality, where entering a query like 'G' filters and displays only relevant company details (e.g., Google). This experiment demonstrates the integration of local and cloud-based storage systems and search functionality in Android.
